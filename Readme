##  This is a quote from Gibbon.

“The remaining fragments of the Greek kingdom in Europe and Asia I shall abandon to the Turkish arms; but the final extinction of the last two dynasties which had reigned Constantinople, should terminate the decline and fall of the Roman empire in the east.“

“The first apprehensions were dispelled  by the victorious Sultan, who contented himself with a tribute of 12,000 ducats; and while his looks explored the continent of the islands in search of prey, he indulged the Morea in a respite of seven years.“

No other writer has so fine an eye for the architecture of a sentence.
